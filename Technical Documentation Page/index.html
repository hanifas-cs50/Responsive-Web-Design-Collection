        <p>Python is a high level general-purpose programming language. It uses a multi-paradigm approach, meaning it
          supports procedural, object-oriented, and some functional programming constructs.</p>

        <p>It was created by Guido van Rossum as a successor to another language (called ABC) between 1985 and 1990, and
          is currently used on a large array of domains like web development, desktop applications, data science,
          DevOps, and automation/productivity.</p>

          <li>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from
            mathematics.</li>
          <li>Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use
            semicolons or parentheses.</li>
          <li>Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and
            classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.</li>

      <article>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">Many PCs and Macs will have python already installed.</p>
        <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
          To check if you have python installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Python or run the following
          on the Command Line (cmd.exe):
        </p>
        <code>C:\Users\Your Name>python --version</code>

        <p>To check if you have python installed on a Linux or Mac, then on linux open the command line or on Mac open
          the Terminal and type:</p>
        <code>python --version</code>

        <p>If you find that you do not have Python installed on your computer, then you can download it for free from
          the following website: <a href="https://www.python.org/">https://www.python.org/</a></p>

          Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 5px;">
          The way to run a python file is like this on the command line:
        </p>
        <code>C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py</code>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">
          Where "helloworld.py" is the name of your python file.
        </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 0;">
          Let's write our first Python file, called "helloworld.py", which can be done in any text editor.
        </p>
        <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>
        <p>
          Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:
        </p>
        <code>C:\Users\Your Name>python helloworld.py</code>
        <p>The output should read:</p>
        <code>Hello, World!</code>
        <p>Congratulations, you have written and executed your first Python program.</p>
